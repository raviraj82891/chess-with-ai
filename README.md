♟️ Chess Engine using Python and Pygame
This is a fully functional chess game built using Python and Pygame, featuring both Player vs Player and AI vs Player modes. The AI utilizes Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for decision making.

🖥️ Features
✅ Complete chess rules implemented (including castling, en passant, promotion)

🎮 GUI built with Pygame for interactive gameplay

🤖 AI opponent using Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning

🔁 Undo move functionality

🔍 Move highlighting and validation

🧠 Customizable AI search depth

🧩 Modular design for easy updates and extensions

🧠 Algorithms Used
Minimax Algorithm
A recursive search algorithm that explores all possible moves to find the optimal path for the AI.

Alpha-Beta Pruning
An optimization over Minimax that reduces the number of nodes evaluated, improving performance.
